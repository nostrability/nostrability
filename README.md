# nostrability

Nostr will have a shot at winnning because of seamless interoperation between any combination of social media clients, and other stuff.

## what is nostrability
The practical documentation of how various [nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol) apps / relays play together.
Two or more nostr apps and/or relays must be involved to invoke a nostrability report.

## short term objective
Nostrability's objective is to assess the degree of friction of interoperability between nostr's many moving parts. \
To start, nostrability provides a simple crowdsourcing [template](https://github.com/alltheseas/nostrability/issues) for documenting poor or lack of interoperability between nostr apps A and B, nostr app C and nostr relay D, and so on. /
Positive nostrability allows for monitoring and advocacy of NIP implementations across many nostr apps. 
Devs are welcome to, and may find using nostrability useful as a platform to request comment from other devs on unvalidated concepts. 

## longer term objective
Negative interoperability: systematically document enough friction points to where a dev, or "integration engineer" can collect bounties for fixing friction points, or work full time on cross-app integration. Dev effort can also be used to intelligently, and systematically [automate testing](https://github.com/nostrCI) of all nostr app A, B ... nostr app N cross-compatibility permutations. \ 
Positive interoperability: build the experience using open blocks that was never possible in the corpo-gulag social media BigCo. 

## non-objective
Nostrability does not aim to get all apps to implement all [NIPs](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips).

## format
To start, I will use the github [issues](https://github.com/alltheseas/nostrability/issues) functionality. It is not clear to me that this is the best format for reporting & discussion. I am open to suggestions.
